						<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>
							In this game jam I collaborated with a fellow student who was proficient in 3d modelling unlike 
							myself and so I was in charge of making the mechanics, putting together the level, and exporting the 
							package in Unity. (The platform model I got from Sketchfab and was actually a dock but I re-arranged 
							parts of it to make long and short platform prefabs)
						</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									<br> <br>
									We collaborated on an idea where you somehow find yourself in a pitch black cave where you 
									will need to scale an abandoned mineshaft to reach the light at the top of the cave. 
									<br> <br>
									There is a lamp lying next to you, when you pick up the lamp, its fuel depletes overtime, 
									making the area of how much you can see smaller and smaller. You'll have to refill the lamp 
									at oil refill points on the path towards the light in order to escape the cave.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">

							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									I've made this a first person, 3d platformer which works with the lamp mechanic as the player
									has to jump across platforms from the abandoned mineshaft while being wary of the time limit 
									they have for their visibility of the platform they have to jump to next.
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/LDGJLightingScene.png" alt=""></a>
									For usual Unity projects, you cant get complete darkness even if you disable all of the lights 
									in the scene, there is still some light bleeding in somehow.
									<br>
									I wanted my game to have complete darkness when the lamp has no light so the player can't see 
									the next platform they need to jump to so they are dependent on the lamp light and keeping it up.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/LDGJLightingSetting.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									I made my project in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline which as more settings in controlling 
									how the game looks than in the standard render pipeline. 
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/LDGJLightingInspector.png" alt=""></a>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									In the environment tab in the lighting settings under rendering: <br>
									- I set the skybox material to none <br>
									- I set the intensity multiplier to zero <br>
									- I turned the real-time shadows and ambient colour to black
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/LDGJCameraInspector.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									These settings made the objects in the scene turn dark but the skybox was only turned a dull 
									blue colour by these settings and not pitch black. I then went to the camera components in 
									the scene's main camera and set the background type from skybox too Uninitiated in the 
									environment section of the camera component.
									<br> <br> <br> <br>
									With these settings, it effectively made the scene pitch black without any light sources.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<h3>The following scrips are the scripts that control the main mechanics of the game.</h3>
								<p>
									Script to control the mechanics of the lamp and the oil / light depletion mechanic:
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-7 col-6-medium col-12-small">								
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/LDGJLampScript.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-5 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									With the way I'd made the the oil depleting system, it depletes by intervals of 0.5 values 
									every second. Which means that the player will have a total of 20 seconds to get from oil 
									refill point to oil refill point to have the most up-time for visibility.
									<br> <br>
									However, this may look odd as the range is decreasing in "steps". Initially for this 
									mechanic, I wanted to use a loop to make the mechanic but the usage of a for loop did not 
									work for me and I was not confident in using a while loop. 
									<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
									To improve this mechanic, I would find a way to make this mechanic more smooth in 
									decreasing the range of the lamp light over time.
								</p>

							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Script attached to oil refill points that refills the lamp to its max amount:
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-7 col-6-medium col-12-small">								
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/LDGJRefillScript.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-5 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									This code only triggers of the lamp game object enters the trigger zone of the oil refill 
									point instead of triggering from when the player steps on it. This is because it gets the 
									lamp script that is attached to the lamp game object. This may create issues such as when 
									the player steps on the oil refill point and expect the oil to refill but the lamp game 
									object did not end up triggering the oil refill point, this may cause confusion and impair 
									the player experience.
									<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
									To improve this mechanic, I would make it so that it triggers when the player enters the 
									trigger zone of the oil refill point.
