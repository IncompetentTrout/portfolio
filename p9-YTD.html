						<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>
							A survival shooter where a bunch of enemies are coming at you in multiple directions and you have to shoot 
							at them to survive. The base of my idea of this game jam was that it was a first-person shooter, where the 
							enemies come at you from anywhere on the map and do damage to your health by colliding with you. And it is 
							aquatic themed, the environment is in a fishbowl, you are shooting bubbles out of your gun for defence, 
							against the enemies which are giant koi fish that know how delicious you are.

									All of the model in this project I have gotten from the internet: <br>

									I began my project by starting to work on importing the environment and baking the Navmesh. 
									I wanted to start on what I thought was the hardest mechanic I wanted to implement into this 
									project, which was the enemy spawner. I could have either decide to instantiate the enemies 
									from set points on the map or I could have them spawn randomly on the Navmesh area. I chose 
									the latter.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Due to odd shape of my Navmesh (with it's round shape, uneven surface, and cut-outs where the 
									environment obstacles are) I had no clue how to implement this. 
									<Br>
									I had an idea to make the spawner points orbit around the centre of the environment, but the 
									enemies might end up spawning in the ground or in the environment obstacles. I followed the 
									following YouTube tutorial and made some code from it.
								</p>
							</div>

									<br> <br>
									This is the main enemy spawner script that utilises object pooling to spawn enemies.
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDObjectPoolScriptImage1.png" alt=""></a> <br>
									The way this enemy spawner script works is that it takes Navmesh Triangulation of the Navmesh 
									Area. This script accesses the Navmesh Triangulation Vertices which are the vertices in the 
									Navmesh area and stores these in an array.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									This is the object pooling script, 
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDObjectPoolScriptImage2.png" alt=""></a>
									that pools game objects that has this script attached, 
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDObjectPoolScriptImage3.png" alt=""></a>
									which is an extension of  this script that is also referenced in the object pooling script.
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDObjectPoolScriptImage4.png" alt=""></a>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									The script first checks for the poolable object which in this case is the enemies. There is a 
									set limit that we can change to how many object will be in the pool in the "enemiesToSpawn" 
									attribute, I set this to 30. <br>
									An enemy spawns every 5 seconds due to the WaitForSeconds function. It then checks if the number 
									of spawned enemies are less than the enemies to spawn and runs the SpawnRandomEnemy() method. <br>
									SpawnRandomEnemy() then randomly spawns a random object from the object pool via the DoSpawnEnemy() 
									method. This method set generates a transform from 0 to the the max length from the 
									Triangulation.vertices list. Then it checks if this transform is on the Navmesh area and if it is, 
									it spawns the enemy at that point.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									After the enemy is spawned, it runs this script which agent component is set to the player so that 
									the enemy moves towards the player to consume them.
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDFishAIScriptImage.png	" alt=""></a>
									The code in the Update() function is so that when the enemy is moving towards the player, the enemy 
									is looking at the player.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									The first-person character controller is built upon the 3rd person character controller I made prior. 
									I modified it by placing the camera on the "head" of the player and coded a script that made the 
									movement of the mouse control the movement of the camera.
								</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDFPCharacterScriptImage.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Aside from a first person character controller, another essential mechanic is the "shooter" part 
									of a first-person-shooter. <br>
									I coded two scripts for this mechanic: the gun script and the target script.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-7 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDGunScriptImage.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-5 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDTargetScriptImage.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									With these scripts, the player can shoot a raycast from their gun game object to a game object in 
									its ray and checks if the hit game object has the target script attached. In my project, only the 
									enemy game object has the target script attached. <br>
									If ray hits an enemy, the health of the enemy is taken away by the damage of the gun. <br>
									If the health of the enemy reaches 0, the enemy game object gets destroyed. This part of the code 
									works against the object pooling code as I can't reuse destroyed game object in the object pool so 
									I limited the amount of enemies that can spawn.
									<br> <br>
									I also made it so that the health of the enemies show on a health bar hovering above them. This 
									heath bar is a slider UI game object that is attached to the enemy so that it follow the enemy as 
									it moves. The enemy's health bar is not active at when the enemy first spawns in and gets set to 
									active once the enemy takes damage from the player.

							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									The player also has a health bar to display their health but on the HUD. This code is made the same 
									way as the enemy's health bar UI code but the health bar is always set to active.
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDPlayerMovScriptImage.png" alt=""></a>

									Due the the theme of my project, I make my project in Unity URP(Universal Render Pipeline). Which 
									has more options than Unity's standard render pipeline, but is less fiddly than Unity HDRP(High 
									Definition Render Pipeline).
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-7 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDGlobalVolumeImage.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-5 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Post processing is built into URP so I utilised it in making the screen distortion effects to make 
									it look like the player is underwater. Before tinkering with post processing, I made the directional 
									light of the level to the colour cyan to start off with the underwater look of the scene. 
									<br> <br>
									I then made a Global volume in the hierarchy so that I could add post processing effects to the volume.
									<br> <br>
									I used a global volume instead of using the other volumes as the post production effects will happen 
									throughout the whole level instead of just in certain set parts of the level.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Adding post process effects in the volume was as simple as pressing a button (Add Override at the 
									bottom) and scrolling through a list of effects and choosing some to add and modify, as long as you 
									know what they do.
									<br> <br> <br>
									Here are the effects that I choose and what they do: 
									<br> <br>
									- Chromatic Aberration - the splitting of the RGB at the edges of the screen 
									<br> <br>
									- Lens Distortion - the intensity of the fish-eye lens effect ("fish"-eye, matches the aquatic theme) 
									<br> <br>
									​- Colour Adjustment - adding more cyan/blue to the scene, because underwater 
									<br> <br>
									- Bloom - having fringes of more cyan light to the scene
								</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/YTDCameraInspectorImage.png" alt=""></a>
									But these effects are useless if the main camera can't even see them. So in the camera component in 
									the main camera, post processing will have to be ticked under the rendering tab so that the camera 
									can see the cool post processing effects.
