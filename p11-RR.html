						<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>
						A project made with the collaboration of the games development and games programming course.
						This was to give an experience of working with a large group of people on one project imitating 
						what it would be like to work at a large studio.
						</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									The class is split into their roles of: Design, Tech, and Art. 
									A producer was selected to lead the project and helping them was the leads of each roles.
									Each of the lead would be in charge of organising and allocating tasks to their team 
									whilst being in communication with the producer and the other leads. 
									The responsibilities of each of the teams were as followed:
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									<a class="icon solid fa-circle"></a>
									The design team crafted game mechanics and narrative concepts that were going to be in the 
									game. </br>
									<a class="icon solid fa-circle"></a>
									The art team were responsible for making the art and environment assets for the game. Due 
									to the size of the art team, it had 2 leads and had different, smaller departments within 
									that team that included 3D, 2D, and UI. </br>
									<a class="icon solid fa-circle"></a>
									The tech team of making the mechanics and the functionality of the game in the chosen game 
									engine of the producer.

						<h3>My Role - Tech Lead</h3>
						<p>
							In my role as the Tech Lead, I was responsible for overseeing the tech team's activities, 
							such as task allocation and deadline management. Providing technical direction for the 
							project's development was crucial. </br>
							This position mirrors the responsibilities of a lead programmer in a game studio, involving 
							supervising coding tasks, guiding the programming team, and ensuring that technical aspects 
							align with the game's design. </br>
							Collaboration with other departments, issue troubleshooting, and maintaining code quality 
							were also essential aspects of my role. </br>
							Overall, being the Tech Lead allowed me to exercise leadership and technical skills, ensuring 
							the smooth progression of the project. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught 
							me valuable lessons in team management and technical problem-solving.

								<p>
									During the first week of this mini-module, the producer and team leads were selected to 
									organise the members that selected their dicipline. After I was assigned as the tech lead, 
									I met with my team to know who exactly was in my team, and what sort of mechanics they 
									prefered to work on for the project. As this project has a high empasis on collaboration, 
									I had also asked for the GitHub accounts of my team so that I could add them to the GitHub 
									Project.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									With that I compiled the roles and mechanics that will be in the project and assigned 
									them to my team, organising and and scheduling when they should be done during the 
									weeks we have for production.												
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									After obtaining and adding all of the GitHub accounts of my team to be collaboratiors on 
									the GitHub project, I put out instructions for my team on how to use Github in conjection 
									with Unity for the collaborative work we were going to do on this project.

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									With this I was able to monitor what my team has done through the different branches of 
									the GitHub project so far and to test if there were any bug that the mechanics made had 
									or if the functionality of the mechanics fit the concept that the mechanics designers 
									from the design team had for them.

							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									I worked with the games mechanics designer to plan out the mechanics my team would make. 
									We decided on the intricacies of the mechanics and whether certain functionalities are 
									possible to be produced by the tech team. </br>
									What was discussed was then compiled onto a document for the tech team to follow.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									For the second week of production, I continued to oversee the progress my team was 
									making on the mechanics for this project. For the mechanics already made up to this 
									point I bug tested them to ensure that they worked as the should and gave feedback on 
									what to change or improve. </br>
									One such example was when I was play-testing the dash mechanic for the player. At that 
									point, the 	dash could make the player dash through walls and would break the 
									playability of the game.

								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Nearing the deadline of production, I was tasked by the producer to block out the 
									levels for our playable beta for the assets and mechanics to be put upon.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									Nearing the end of this projectâ€™s deadline, there were still some tasks that were yet 
									to be completed so I had to re-allocate idle members of the tech team to help each other 
									out to do what we can to meet the deadline for the playable game build. I had also 
									helped out in implementing the animations for the player Character. </br>
									For my deliverable for this project, I had to compile a technical design document that 
									pertained to this project. This Document detailed: the list of features captured from 
									GDD, reasoning for choice of game engine, and high-level diagrams to illustrate software 
									design.
