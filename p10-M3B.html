						<h3>Pre-Production</h3>
						<p>
							In the sector of mobile games in the games industry, it is majoritively saturated with casual games, 
							due to the nature of mobile games being easy to load and access and are able to be played anywhere. 
							Mobile phones are the most widely owned piece of tech thougout the whole world, meaning that the 
							platform of mobile games have a very large audience to tap into. As mobile games are limited to the 
							hardware of mobile phones, mobile games are lightweight which make them be dependent on being optimised. 
							The Unity Game Engine is best suited for developing mobile games as it is widely used for prototyping 
							and making lightweight projects.

									During my brainstorming of the game we will be making for this mini module. I wanted to make a 
									game that did not seem too ‘mass produced’ such as many games that populate the apps store when I 
									inspected what sort of games that are there.
									<br> <br>
									I thought about the most popular genres of mobile games which my mind immediately went to Candy 
									Crush by King. This game is a large player in the match 3 mobile game space with players from 
									multiple different backgrounds. Audiences from many ages ranging from the elderly to children pick 
									up this game as an easy form of entertainment right on their phones. This shows that this game and 
									it’s wider franchise is very effective in maximising the amount of players it can cultivate out of 
									the mobile games market.

									To add a bit of nuance the concept of a match 3 game, instead of having levels the match 3 board 
									will be triggered when the player goes into battle with an enemy and the matches would either do 
									damage to the enemy or heals the player.

								<h3>Process and Development</h3>

								<h6>Base Match 3 Mechanic</h6>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									I was a programmer in this team developing this game, I was in charge with making the mechanics 
									in order for there to be functionality in this game. The main mechanic I was focused on making 
									was the match 3 mechanic. I first look up a tutoial to make the match 3 board and then from there 
									added the additional functionality. 
								</p>

							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									After the I finished following the tutorial there were a major bug that the tiles that were matched 
									popped all of the matching tiles it was connected to instead of just 3 or 4 in straight lines 
									instead of in L shapes.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<h6>Damage and Health Matches</h6>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									After fixing that bug from the base match 3 mechanic, I went on to set the values of the tiles.
									<br> <br>
									The tiles that did damage would do 5 damage per tile, so when they are matched, they would do 
									15-30 damage to the enemy when matched.
									<br> <br>

								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/M3BDamageAndHealthImage1.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									When ‘Heal’ tiles get matched, the player will heal by the 10 per matched tile.
								</p>

							<div class="col-12 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<h6>Limited Moves Within Turns</h6>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									To make this a proper damage sequence, I made it so that the player can only do 3 move per turn. 
									After each turn, if the current enemy’s health isn’t fully depleted, the enemy would do damage to 
									the player.
									<br> <br>
									Turn counters at the corner of the screen to tell the player how many moves they have left in the turn.

								<h6>Battle Stage</h6>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">	
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/M3BBattleStageImage1.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									When the player encounters an enemy, the match 3 board would show in the canter of the screen. 
									This would leave empty spaces on the sides of the board. I decided to have the player and the 
									current enemy on either side of the board.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									I achieved this by setting a position a set amount of distance away from the enemy to make the 
									space for the board. 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">	
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/M3BBattleStageImage2.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									This make it so that when the player goes into the battle sequence, the player would teleport to 
									that position until the battle ends and the player teleports back to where it was prior to the battle. 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">	
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/M3BBattleStageImage3.png" alt=""></a>

								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/M3BBattleStageImage4.png" alt=""></a>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<p>
									By the end of this process this was what the battle stage looked like whenever the player would enter
									battle with an encountered enemy.
